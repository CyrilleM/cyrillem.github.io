    <h2>WHY LEADERSHIP?</h2>

      <p>
        <h3>There are several ways to live: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4><li> You live to spoil the resources you found on earth</li></h4>
        <h4><li>You do not care about resources, you wish you weren't born</li></h4>
        <h4><li>You strive to leave a better world</li></h4>
         I contemplate that with the world population at 7 Billions today projected to be at 11 Billions by 2050, everyone has a role to play to leave a better world for the next generation
        <h3>Why then does it seem so difficult for Africa to emerge?</h3> <br>
         The answer his questions is not obvious. However, I think Africa needs leaders that inspire ressources growth instead of destruction through self accumulation. When people get to live to leave a better place, they stop the endless and selfiss accumulation of resources, and start inspiring the community for good.
         This will happen, when leaders understand the need for education, training talents to the right skills that will enable their own potential.

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>
         I spent several years in the private sector, enjoying a fast growing career in Operations Management, where I got exposed to senior leadership in several multinational companies, on projects that spanned the Globe.
         Currently, I dedicate my time and energy to research on the leadership field, basically how to adapt what works so well in developped worlds esppecially the US, to a continent that is in need of leaders that can polish the very resources Africa is wasting today
