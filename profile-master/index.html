    <h2>Why Leadership?</h2>

      <p>
        <h3>There are several ways of living: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4><li> You live to spoil the resources you found on earth</li></h4>
        <h4><li>You do not care about resources, you wish you weren't born</li></h4>
        <h4><li>You strive to leave a better world</li></h4>
        I contemplate that with the world population at 7 Billions today projected to be at 11 Billions by 2050, everyone has a role to play to leave a better world for the next generation
        <h3>Why then does it seem so difficult for Africa to emerge?</h3> <br>
        The answer to this questions is not obvious, however, I think Africa needs leadership that inspires ressources growth instead of depletion. When people get to live to leave a better place, they stop the endless and selfiss accumulation of resources, and start inspiring the community for good.
        This will happen, when leaders understand the need for education, training talents to the right skills that will enable their own potential.
